# Aeroelastic Analysis of a Swept Fixed Wing

# Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB script designed to solve flutter-related problems for fixed swept wing aircraft and simulate the aircraft's response to a gust. The derivation of the problem is done following a Ritz-Galerkin approximation for the displacements and a strip-theory for aerodynamic behaviour.

# Contents
- Derivation of the mathematical model
- Computation of coupled bending-torsional modes
- flutter analysis
- System response under 1-cosine gust

# Tools Used
Principle of Virtual work, Strip theory, Ritz Galerkin, modal analysis, ode45()

# Requirements
MATLAB (version R2019b or later recommended)
Additional MATLAB toolboxes: Aerospace Toolbox, Control System Toolbox

# Results
The script generates visualizations and analysis results, including:
Flutter velocity and dynamic perssure.
System response to perturbations in maximum bending moment at root.

# Script Components
To run the script, simply download the attached MATLAB file or check the jupyter notebook perview.
